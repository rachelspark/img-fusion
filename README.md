## Image Fusion with Kandinsky 2

Demo app that blends two images and renders the resulting output image, fast and simple using Modal.

The image generation model used is [`Kandinsky 2`](https://github.com/ai-forever/Kandinsky-2), a multilingual text2image latent diffusion model. The backend is built with [`FastAPI`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [`Modal`](https://modal.com/docs/guide) (and [`Poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) as a dependency manager), and the frontend is built with [`React`](https://react.dev/), [`Next.js`](https://nextjs.org/), and [`TailwindCSS`](https://tailwindcss.com/).
